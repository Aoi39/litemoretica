# Litemoretica

Adds features and fixes to the [Litematica mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/litematica).

- `schematicEditReplaceSelection`: Copies the selected area(s) from the world into the litematic. This is useful for telling Litematica that an area is correct.
- Easy place fixes:
  - Prevent easy place from placing blocks where it shouldn't.
- Fixes an [incompatibility](https://github.com/AmyMialeeMods/visible-barriers/issues/22) with [Visible Barriers](https://modrinth.com/mod/visible-barriers).
